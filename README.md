# odin-recipes
A project for The Odin Project foundations course

This is the first project in The Odin Project foundations course. This project is meant to practice HTML by building a basic recipe website. 

The website will have a main index page with links to recipes

This project will initially only have basic HTML, but will be revisited at a later date to style with CSS.
